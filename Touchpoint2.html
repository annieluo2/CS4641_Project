                      We are trying to find a correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and the median days pending to sale (MDPS) using unsupervised learning, namely clustering algorithms so that we can eventually predict future MDPS values. This is a regression problem because our target is the numeric values of median days pending to sale. The range of our values is 7-80 days though we split them into categories for our clustering algorithms to reduce it. To do this, we are utilizing housing datasets from Zillow as well as a Johns Hopkins COVID-19 case dataset.

                      The Zillow housing datasets were organized by metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), and we chose the top 19 MSAs because they had the least amount of information missing due to being major cities such as New York City and Los Angeles. The top MSAs also generally experience a lot of movement due to their population sizes. Housing data points for each housing feature were provided on a weekly basis. To combine the Zillow housing datasets with the COVID dataset which gave daily case information by county, we summed up the points in a week to give a weekly total for the same week day, and we combined counties’ data within an MSA.

                    We started by removing NAN and extreme values such as 0 from the dataset. Then we filled in the missing value with a suitable number by predicting values based upon the closeness of nearby datapoints. However, there were a few outliers that could have possibly been caused by sale prices or days-pending that were larger than the peer cities.

                      We created correlation matrices to analyze the relationships between our features (median list price, median sale price, for-sale inventory, and COVID cases) and the target variable (MDSP). From our matrices we determined that we could get rid of median list price as a feature because it was highly correlated with median sale price (0.98). We decided to keep median sale price as a feature because median list price has the lower correlation with the target variable (-0.16 or -0.19) in all three models though median sale price still has a relatively low correlation with our target variable. Our final features were median sale price (MSP), for-sale inventory (FSI), and COVID cases.

                    <p>
                      With our final features and target variable, we observed a positive correlation between MDPS and FSI. There was a slight positive correlation between COVID cases & MDPS and COVID cases & FSI. COVID cases had very little correlation with MSP. There was a slight negative correlation between MSP & FSI and MSP & MDPS.

                    The clustering algorithms that we used are PCA, KMeans, DBSCAN, and GMM. Our objectives for the algorithms were to find relationships between our features, determine the outliers, and to gain a better understanding of our datasets. For PCA, since we were only dealing with 2-3 features (housing data and/or COVID case data), we realized that we did not need its dimensionality reducing features, but it helped us visualize our data. We altered the range of values to the following to better visualize how values were clustered if at all:
                  </p> 
                  <p>
                    0: 0-19 days
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    1: 20-39 days
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    2: 40-59 days
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    3: 60-79 days
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Graphing 2 principal components, we see that our target values (MDPS) are scattered across multiple clusters. For the Pre-COVID Housing Dataset, we can see that some of them generally stick to one area (0’s in the middle right, 2’s in the top left and bottom center, and 3’s in the top left) despite overlapping. Between the two PCA graphs during COVID, there doesn’t seem to be a clearer relationship with the combined housing and COVID dataset compared to the dataset with only the housing data.

                    We noticed that clustering based on K-means and GMM didn’t help us find a relationship between these features because it’s based on the ratio of the median sale price and for-sale inventory. We attempted to evaluate the clusters by using F1 score, which calculates our model’s precision (proportion of correct to incorrect predictions) and recall (proportion of points that we correctly predicted). Since K-means clustering assigned random cluster numbers rather than attempting to create a cluster labeled for each metropolitan area for which we generated combined housing-COVID datasets for, we had F1 scores of 0.1 (signifying very low precision and recall) on each attempt to cluster using COVID cases and median days pending to sale in a metro area. Therefore, unless we can create clusters with the metro area labels, F1 score on our K-means clustering does not give us any useful insights. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     This was an attempt to use K-means clustering (with 19 clusters) with the 19 metropolitan areas included over a 30 week period from January to August 2020 over the features of COVID cases and median days pending to sale. However, we could not find many generic correlations between COVID cases in a city and median days pending to sale, as many of our clusters ended up depicting either a constant case count or an insignificant variance in median days pending to sale. If we removed the weeks where a metro area had 0 cases, this could potentially provide more useful clusters, but would cause many discrepancies between the number of timepoints each city is represented by in the dataset.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     We used DBSCAN to find outliers when we clustered the median sale price and for-sale inventory. As we can see in the given plot, the purple points represent the outliers as they are the points which could not be fit into any cluster.

                       Utilizing clustering algorithms was not very effective for our datasets in general. Additionally, it was hard to measure their performance since we do not have a group of “correct clusters”. Overall, correlation matrices helped us recognize the relationships between our features and remove any redundant ones, PCA helped us visualize our data, and DBSCAN helped us find outliers in our data.
